# Project Brief: Snap and Seek

## Core identity
- **Tagline:** Hide. Seek. Snap. Find them all.
- **Type:** Hackathon project — landing + Supabase + location/map features.

## Scope
- Landing page with hero and list of games from Supabase.
- **Location test page** (`/location-test`): browser GPS, in-app Google Map, 10s polling, location history as numbered pins, countdown until next ping, points list at bottom.
- All location/map behavior is client-side (Geolocation API + Maps JavaScript API). Free tier / hackathon-friendly.

## Non-goals (for now)
- No RLS on Supabase (service role used for hackathon shortcut).
- No embedded map on home page (only on location test).
